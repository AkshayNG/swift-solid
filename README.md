SOLID design principles for Swift programming

SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design principles Uncle Bob.

1. Single Responsibility: A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job. 
2. Open-Closed: Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. A class should be extendable without modifying the class itself.
3. Liskov Substitution: Every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class. 
4. Interface Segregation: A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesnâ€™t use.
5. Dependency Inversion: Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.


These principles establish practices that lend to developing software with considerations for maintaining and extending as the project grows. Adopting these practices can also contribute to avoiding code smells, refactoring code, and Agile or Adaptive software development.
